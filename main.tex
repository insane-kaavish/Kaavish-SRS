\subsection{Risks}
The risks involved with this project are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The data collection process for the prediction model is not successful and augmented data is used to a large extent. 
    \item The introduction of the augmented data would mean compromising on the accuracy of the prediction model which is central to our project. 
    \item The solution caters to a specific Socio-economic group rendering it useless to the large masses which are the most impacted when it comes to electricity bill hikes.
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{usecase.png}
    \caption{Use Case Diagram}
    \label{fig: Use Case Diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Description:} The use case diagram serves the important purpose of visually giving a basic rundown of how the App will function for different Stakeholders. The Box indicates the boundary of the Applications and objects within the box are basically functional requirements of the application shown visually.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose: } The purpose of this Use case Diagram is to give an overview of all the Actors and how the interaction with the software will look like. The Use case diagram acts like a visual tool that gives a topological perspective of all different types of interactions and relationships.
    \item \textbf{Actors:} Actors are all the external entities involved in the operations of the App. In our Use case diagram, we have 4 different actors. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The user: The user is the primary Actor of the application. they will interact will all the different features in the App. They will provide inputs, be able to see the analytics, sign up, log in, and log out.
        \item The Admin: Admin will be the Actors who will only be responsible for the management of the users.
        \item Predictive Model: It will be the Main model which will be trained and here is where the forecasted/ predicted results of the electricity consumption will come from.
        \item Optimization Algorithm: This will be the added model/Algorithm that will be responsible for recommending different actions to users in order to make their electricity consumption as optimal as possible.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Use Cases:} Use cases represent all the various functionalities of the software. Each use case represents its specified interaction
    \item \textbf{Associations:} The associations are represented by arrows, that simply signify an interaction between an actor and the use case.
    \item \textbf{System Boundary:} The system boundary visually shows which parts of the entire interactive experience lie within the system and which lie outside.
\end{itemize}


\section{System Diagram and Description:} 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{system.png}
    \caption{Use Case Diagram}
    \label{fig: System Diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Description}
The system diagram illustrates the various interfaces of the final design of our project, which consists of four main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mobile Application
    \item Analytic tab
    \item Database
    \item Computational Models
\end{enumerate}

The mobile application is the primary component through which users will interact with the system. Initially, users will be prompted to sign up or log in to the application. User credentials will be authenticated, as security is a critical non-functional requirement for our mobile application. After successful login, first-time users will be asked to provide data on their appliance usage to predict their electricity bill based on subsequent usage. The prediction model will use this usage data to forecast electricity consumption. Subsequently, an optimization plan for the user's electricity usage will be provided based on the predicted units. Additionally, users will have access to analytics, allowing them to review their electricity consumption for the previous month and analyze room-wise electricity usage.

Users revisiting the application will be able to view their analytics and the optimization plan provided to them previously to reduce their electricity bill. In addition, users at all times will have the power to change their usage patterns, since the patterns will be different for each season based on different factors. Once the user usage data is updated, the prediction model will calculate the units based on the newly inputted usage data.
